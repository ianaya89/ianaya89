> I build stuff with code. From frontend interfaces to cloud infrastructure, I enjoy solving problems and helping teams ship better software.

I'm a senior software engineer with a passion for building scalable web applications and cloud infrastructure. Beyond writing code, I enjoy sharing knowledge through speaking at developer conferences, creating educational content, and mentoring teams to deliver better software.
I believe in pragmatic solutions over perfect code. Good software is maintainable, well-tested, and solves real problems. My approach combines technical expertise with a startup mindset, focusing on products that make a meaningful impact.
