I am Full Stack Developer, Tech Trainer and Speaker. I have been working, teaching and spreading JavaScript technologies for more than 10 years.
I am mostly working with JavaScript, Vue.js, Node.js but I like to contribute to any kind of dev community or OSS project. I love coding, teaching and field hockey. When I am not working or traveling, you can find me playing hockey in Buenos Aires. 💻🏑⚽️🧡
